Compute an object kinetic and its momentum.

1. The input are:
        Objectâ€™s mass (in kilograms)
        Velocity (in meters per second)
        
2. Computations:

        Kinetic is equal to (1/2) times mass times velocity to the power of 2.
        Momentum is equal to Mass of object in killogram times the velocity in meter per second.

3. Output:
         The kinetic and momentum of the object*/
